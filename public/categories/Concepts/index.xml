It provides a formal framework for creating if-then statements. Formal logic statements can be difficult for beginners because of the symbols and vocabulary used. Below is a cheat sheet for some of the basic symbols and definitions.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Have you ever tried to describe the color red to someone who suffers from protanopia, deuteranopia, protanomaly, or deuteranomaly? It is nearly impossible since those who are red-green color blind are missing the corresponding photoreceptors. The experience of seeing red is so familiar to those who have experienced it. And that type of experience, one which is difficult to communicate, does not change based on other experiences, is unique to the individual experiencing it, and immediately recognized, is qualia. &lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>A Brief Introduction to Bayes&amp;#8217; Theorem</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Bayes’ Theorem stated is, “the conditional probability of A given B is the conditional probability of B given A scaled by the relative probability of A compared to B”. I find it easier to understand through a practical explanation. Let’s say you are having a medical test performed at the recommendation of your doctor, who recommends tests to everyone because they get a nice kickback and college tuition is not cheap! You are young and healthy and are being tested for the existence of a new form of cancer that only exists in 1% of the population. These cancer detecting tests accurately detect the cancer 8 out of 10 times in an infected individual. However, they “detect” cancer in 1 out of 10 cancer free patients. Your test results come back positive! But before you get worried, let’s figure out the chance that you actually have cancer.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
