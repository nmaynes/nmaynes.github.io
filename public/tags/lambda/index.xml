      <description>&lt;p&gt;I recently started working on a workflow for picking up files from S3, processing them, and writing the&#xA;results to another S3 location. This is a common pattern in data processing pipelines and our team wanted to see whether&#xA;we could do it using AWS serverless services. We were able to get it running via Lambda&#xA;functions and event triggers published to an AWS EventHub. The entire workflow was fairly easy to stand up once we&#xA;grasped how the various services worked together.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
