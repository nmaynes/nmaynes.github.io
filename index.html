<a href=/tags/lambda>lambda</a><div>I recently started working on a workflow for picking up files from S3, processing them, and writing the results to another S3 location. This is a common pattern in data processing pipelines and our team wanted to see whether we could do it using AWS serverless services. We were able to get it running via Lambda functions and event triggers published to an AWS EventHub. The entire workflow was fairly easy to stand up once we grasped how the various services worked together.

But have no fear! It is easy once you understand a couple of key concepts. Here is a working example using boto3.resource("s3") that has been tested against pandas 1.3.2. It is worth noting that the following will only work with pandas versions greater than 1.2.0.
from io import BytesIO import boto3 import pandas from pandas import util df = util.

<a href=/tags/hosting>hosting</a><div>I started the process of moving my personal blog over a year ago, when the global pandemic brought on by the COVID-19 virus sent my local area into lock down. The reasons for doing so were simple enough, my web hosting bill had grown north of $200 dollars a month for my personal blog. Don&rsquo;t get me wrong, Wordpress is great! I just wanted to get my blog onto something more appropriate for the audience (read, pretty small).

I recently stumbled on such a problem when trying to configure a set of Object Relational Mappings (ORM) to support an application with the same set of table objects across different schemas in Postgres. Developing an ORM to support this pattern, a multi-tenant database model, proved challenging because of where I started. Below, I will detail the correct way to support the multi-tenant pattern as well as various approaches I came across and why they should not be used.

<a href=/tags/normalization>normalization</a><div>Normalizing data is a common data engineering task. It prepares information to be stored in a way that minimizes duplication and is digestible by machines. It also aims to solve other problems and issues that are out of scope for this particular article but worth reading about if you find yourself struggling to understand jokes about E. F. Codd. This begs the question, why does normalization matter when entering information in a table or organizing a spreadsheet?

First things first. Versions matter! Before wasting your time trying to get Pycharm and WSL to play nicely, make sure you are running PyCharm2020.2 or greater and WSL 2. If you a) have no idea what those versions mean or b) are not sure what version you are using, allow me a chance to explain.

I was tasked with hitting a rate limited REST API with just under 4 million requests. My first attempt was simple. Gather and build a block of search queries, POST each one to the API, process the results, and finally insert them in a database. Here is what the code looked like:

But I do not want the other party to know what name I am searching. This problem may seem unrealistic but imagine a data breach where tons of personal information is leaked. You want to check whether you were impacted in the breach but do not trust the party hosting the personal information to keep your query safe.
