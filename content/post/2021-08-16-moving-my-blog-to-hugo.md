title: "Moving My Personal Blog From Wordpress to Hugo"
date: 2021-08-16T11:13:00-04:00

I started the process of moving my personal blog over a year ago, when the global pandemic 
brought on by the COVID-19 virus sent my local area into lock down.
The reasons for doing so were simple enough, my web hosting bill had grown north of 
$200 dollars a month for my personal blog. Wordpress is great!

* Hosting costs for my small sites went from $50 dollars a year to over $250 dollars a year
* I no longer wanted to play with plugins
* Managing comments became tedious. Spam, spam, and more spam. 
* I wanted something simple that could be hosted on Github Pages.
