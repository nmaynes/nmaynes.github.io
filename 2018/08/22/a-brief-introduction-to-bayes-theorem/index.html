I find it easier to understand through a practical explanation. Let’s say you are having a medical test performed at the recommendation of your doctor, who recommends tests to everyone because they get a nice kickback and college tuition is not cheap! You are young and healthy and are being tested for the existence of a new form of cancer that only exists in 1% of the population. These cancer detecting tests accurately detect the cancer 8 out of 10 times in an infected individual. However, they “detect” cancer in 1 out of 10 cancer free patients. Your test results come back positive! But before you get worried, let’s figure out the chance that you actually have cancer.</p><p>This is a job for conditional probability. You want to know the probability that the test detected cancer in you, a young healthy individual. “The chance of an event is the number of ways it could happen given all possible outcomes”[1]:</p><p>or</p><p> </p><p>When the result is considered in conjunction with the likelihood of other outcomes, it is not that troubling. The table below has the likelihood for each of the outcomes:</p><pre><code>&lt;th&gt;
  Cancer (1% of Pop.)
&lt;/th&gt;

&lt;th&gt;
  No Cancer (99% of Pop.)
&lt;/th&gt;
</code></pre><pre><code>&lt;td&gt;
  True Positive&lt;br /&gt; 1% x 80% = .8%
&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;
  False Positive&lt;br /&gt; 99% x 10% = 9.9%
&lt;/td&gt;
</code></pre><pre><code>&lt;td&gt;
  False Negative&lt;br /&gt; 1% x 20% = .2%
&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;
  True Negative&lt;br /&gt; 99% x 90% = 89.1%
&lt;/td&gt;
</code></pre><p> </p><p>The chance of cancer for a true positive is only .8%! A false positive is much more likely at 9.9%. The likelihood you have cancer even with a positive test result is low. You should definitely seek a second opinion.</p><p>It is important to keep in mind that we are calculating odds of an event given <strong><em>all</em></strong> possibilities. You probably do rough versions of this calculation daily. “Given the dark rain clouds outside and rain in the forecast, I will take an umbrella since I believe it will rain while I am out.” If that is not enough to get you excited about Bayes and his contribution to statistics, know that he did it all in an effort to prove the existence of God!
